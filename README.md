# DAO Project Management Smart Contract

A decentralized project management system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This system enables DAOs to manage projects, contractors, and milestone-based payments with built-in voting mechanisms.

## üéØ Features

- **Project Management**
  - Create and manage multiple projects
  - Assign contractors to projects
  - Set project budgets and milestone targets
  - Track project completion status

- **Milestone System**
  - Define multiple milestones per project
  - Set milestone-specific budgets
  - Track milestone completion status
  - Automated fund release upon milestone completion

- **Voting Mechanism**
  - Democratic milestone approval process
  - Configurable minimum vote threshold
  - Protection against double voting
  - Automated completion triggers

- **Security Features**
  - Role-based access control
  - Input validation for all parameters
  - Protected fund management
  - Safeguards against common attack vectors

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Clarity and Stacks blockchain
- A Stacks wallet for contract deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dao-project-management
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
clarinet install
```

3. Run tests
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Contract Deployment

1. Build the contract
```bash
clarinet build
```

2. Deploy using Clarinet console or Stacks deployer
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating a New Project

```clarity
(contract-call? 
    .dao-project-management 
    create-project 
    u1  ;; project-id
    'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM  ;; contractor
    u5  ;; total-milestones
    u1000000  ;; total-budget
)
```

### Adding a Milestone

```clarity
(contract-call?
    .dao-project-management
    add-milestone
    u1  ;; project-id
    u1  ;; milestone-id
    "Complete Frontend Development"  ;; description
    u200000  ;; amount
)
```

### Voting on Milestone Completion

```clarity
(contract-call?
    .dao-project-management
    vote-milestone-completion
    u1  ;; project-id
    u1  ;; milestone-id
)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated against predefined bounds
   - Project and milestone IDs are checked for uniqueness
   - Vote counts are protected against overflow

2. **Access Control**
   - Only contract owner can create projects
   - Only project owner can add milestones
   - Voting rights can be restricted to DAO members

3. **Fund Safety**
   - Milestone payments are released only after sufficient votes
   - Built-in checks prevent double-completion of milestones

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
